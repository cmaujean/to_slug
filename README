ToSlug
======

This plugin adds a to_slug method to String instances. With this method you 
can easily generate a slug from any string. Slugs can be used for URLs, since
all 'dangerous' characters have been filtered out.

Example
-------

  "Hello World".to_slug # => "hello-world"

  "The World is Beautiful!".to_slug # => "the-world-is-beautiful"

See the specs for more (complex) examples.

Installation
------------



Dependencies
------------

This plugin depends on the 'unicode' gem (sudo gem install unicode). See
http://www.yoshidam.net/Ruby.html#unicode for more information.
